Some custom slash commands for slack


Directions
-----------
1. Create an incoming data hook in Slack.
1. Host this Node app. I used Heroku.
1. Configure the DICE_REPLY_HOOK environment variable for your hosted app with the hook URL from above.
1. Set up slash commands pointing to the hosted endpoints.
